    1. Adding Members (Adding Member as a leader or member)
    http://localhost:3000/accounts/add/:subDepartment/:role/:userTelephone
        What really happens when a new member is added to a subdepartment as a leader or member.
            the user's document gets updated
                the subdepartment object for that user gets updated
                    the old subdepartment's leader or member object active property is changed to false
                    the new subdepartment's leader or member object active property is changed to true 
                work: {
                    type: Object,
                    default: [
